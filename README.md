# Directions and information
Located in this Repo you will find 2 documents of code titled
NoSQL_setup_starter and NoSQL_analysis_starter. You will also 
find a resources folder that contains the JSON file needed
to download the data used for the homework. In order to 
correctly run the code, first run all the code in the 
NoSQL_setup_starter file. Once that is completed, you
should be able to run all of the code in the 
NoSQL_analysis_starter file without issues.

# How the code was generated
For the code I used the Xpert Learning assistant to help
fix my code for changing latitude and longitude to decimals
on the setup_starter. I also used it to help with some syntax 
errors I encountered for my match query in my aggregate pipeline
and syntax errors for finding latitude and longitude within .01
degrees of penang flavour. My classmate Alice also helped me fix
my code for the latitude and longitude query and correcting 
a syntax issue on my london as local authority query.
